Venom won its second weekend,time news,2024-11-05 10:32:02,https://time.news/venom-won-its-second-weekend,"19
In a weekend that‍ maintained the attendance average of recent weeks, Venom⁣ managed to maintain the first place‍ obtained ⁣last ⁢week⁢ in its national premiere.
107,000 people‍ went to see it and the grand total ‌reached 345,000,⁢ so probably ‍in two weeks it will match what Joker 2 sold, which‌ got a ‍lot more ⁤press and promotion. Although both share their ‍poor critical reception.
According to Ultracine, Terrifier 3 came in⁢ second place‌ with ⁣nearly 72,000 viewers. Meanwhile, ⁣Wild Robot ⁤was the one ‌who completed the podium.
The Room⁣ Next Door was ‍the ⁢second best premiere, with 14,506 viewers in 6th place and Godzilla Minus One‍ came in third with 2,498 and in 10th⁤ place.

Interview⁢ Between Time.news Editor‍ and Film Industry⁤ Expert
Time.news Editor: Good ‌morning, and thank​ you⁣ for joining us today!⁣ We're excited to discuss the recent success of 'Venom: The Last Dance'⁤ and the current state of box office hits. To help us unpack this,​ we have film industry‌ expert Dr. Sarah ‍Connors with us. ​Welcome, Dr. Connors!
Dr. Connors: Good morning! Thank you for‍ having me.
Editor: ⁣Let's dive right in. 'Venom: The Last Dance' managed to stay at the top of the box office this past weekend, with an impressive 107,000 viewers. What do you think contributed to its ability to maintain the first place from its national premiere?
Dr. Connors: Well, first and foremost,​ the anticipation surrounding the 'Venom' franchise certainly plays ⁤a significant ⁢role. Fans of the ⁤comic book series⁣ tend⁢ to flock to ⁣the theater, and with the sequel, there's already a built-in audience. Additionally, the action-packed trailers and marketing​ strategies have⁤ kept⁤ the buzz alive, even if critical reception hasn't been stellar.
Editor: Interestingly, you mentioned the critical‍ reception. Both⁣ 'Venom'⁢ and⁣ 'Joker ‍2' have ⁤faced poor reviews, yet 'Venom' is projected to match 'Joker 2″‍ in sales soon. What does this say about audience preferences?
Dr. Connors: ⁤It highlights⁤ the disconnect sometimes between critical acclaim and audience appetite. Many viewers prioritize entertainment value over critical analysis when⁣ deciding on a film. Many will go for popular franchises or⁢ films⁣ that have a​ fun, adventurous premise, irrespective⁤ of⁤ what critics think. Audiences enjoy being entertained, ‌and 'Venom' offers that ​thrill, while 'Joker 2' has a more ⁢serious, somber tone that may not resonate with everyone.
Editor: Very true. Is there anything specific ‍about 'Venom' that⁤ stands out in⁣ terms ⁢of its box office ⁣appeal compared ⁣to other films like 'Terrifier 3,' ⁤which came in ⁤second with ‍nearly 72,000 viewers?
Dr. Connors: Absolutely. 'Venom' benefits⁤ from⁣ a wider marketing machine and a more recognizable title.⁤ While 'Terrifier 3″⁢ is gaining traction and has ⁤its⁤ own dedicated fanbase, it caters to a niche audience that appreciates horror specifically.​ On the other hand, 'Venom' blends action and comic book lore, which has a ‌broader appeal across different demographics.
Editor: We ‌also see other films like 'Wild Robot' performing‌ well. ​Is there a reason audiences are turning toward a wider variety of genres ‌in the ⁤current‍ market?
Dr. Connors: Yes, definitely! The diversity of films currently available is helping to cater to different tastes and preferences. Audiences are becoming more open to exploring different genres,‍ including animated features like​ 'Wild Robot,' which can attract ⁤families and younger viewers. The‌ interplay of new releases and maintaining established franchise continuity is creating a healthy competitive environment at the box‌ office.
Editor: It seems like there's a lot of momentum in the film industry right now. How do you see this trend⁤ evolving in the‍ coming months?
Dr. Connors: I believe we'll see a continued blending of⁣ genres. Audiences enjoy variety, and studios are recognizing the potential financial rewards of diversifying their offerings. With more franchises ​like 'Venom' releasing in the ⁢superhero category and unique independent films gaining attention, we might see some exciting shifts in viewer demographics. The⁤ key will be for studios to balance both ‌blockbuster features and innovative storytelling to keep audiences engaged.
Editor: Great⁢ insights! Before we wrap‍ up, do you have ⁣any predictions for‌ future box‌ office hits or sleeper successes?
Dr. Connors: Based on current trends, I believe films ​that merge established⁤ franchises with fresh storytelling⁢ will⁤ dominate. Also, keep an eye on indie films that are breaking the mold—there's potential for surprises in⁤ that sector. The critical reception might not dictate all, but authentic stories resonate ⁤well with audiences, which could lead to unexpected successes.
Editor: Thank you, Dr. Connors! It's been enlightening to explore the box office landscape ​with you. We look forward to ⁣seeing how these trends evolve.
Dr. Connors: Thank you! I had a wonderful time discussing these‍ trends with you. 0 comments 0 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email"
Box office: Venom 3 pulls big pre-Halloween audiences,Nathan Jolly,2024-10-28 04:03:04,https://mumbrella.com.au/box-office-venom-3-pulls-big-pre-halloween-audiences-854130,"Horror flicks and supervillains ruled the Australian box office this weekend, as Venom: The Last Dance, Smile 2, and Terrifier 3 drove a 34% jump in takings, compared to the prior weekend.
The third film in the Tom Hardy-led Venom franchise took in $4.71 million during its opening weekend, well ahead of horror-thriller Smile 2, which took in another $1.1 million to bring it's total to $3.64 million.
Kate Winslet's new film, Lee, brought in $889,000 over opening weekend, with preview screenings tipping it over the one-million-mark, according to HOYTS.

Fourth place went to The Wild Robot with $449,000 bringing its total takings in this country to a cool $15.41 million after six weeks.
Horror film Terrifier 3 took $244,000 the weekend before Halloween to bring its cume to $1.92 million, while animated Japanese movie, Look Back, which brought in $151,000 in its first week.
In seventh place was Transformers One, which added $136,000 to its $8.15 million box office, while Aussie flick, Runt, was at eighth with $134,000 – bringing its box office to $5.72 million.

'Megalopolis' not making either list is surprising. But what is stunning is it is nowhere to be found among the more than 80 movies listed on their daily list, nor has it since it was released. 'Goodrich' (Bleecker Street) with Michael Keaton, which grossed barely over $1 million is #24 Monday. 'The Apprentice' (Briarcliff), with a $4 million total, made the top 10 its opening week. Both films have the same $19.99 rental price as 'Megalopolis.'

Clearly the poor general audience word of mouth for Coppola's film is a fact. But perhaps its status as a film which was distributed as a service deal by Lionsgate (as effectively as was possible under tough circumstances) reduced its marketing and other awareness elements. Still, it's shocking.
Less shocking is that Netflix subscribers preferred between two prime releases the conventional holiday-oriented rom-com '
'Emilia' isn't in the top 10, which is not surprising. The Mexican-made, French produced (it's their Oscar submission) drama centering on an audacious character's transition into a woman is a specialized film, and one that if it had a conventional theatrical release, even in the hands of Neon or A24, would have been an unlikely box office top 10 contender. The time to see if there is a reaction will be in January after the Oscar nominations.
The VOD charts are otherwise little changed, with '
As always, more turnover at Netflix. Two other originals debuted — 'The Lost Children,' a dramatization of how a group of children survived a Colombian plane crash, currently #2, and the documentary 'Return of the King: The Fall and Rise of Elvis Presley,' focusing on his comeback 1968 NBC special.

UK-Ireland box office down year-on-year in October; hopes pinned on November slate,Ben Dalton,2024-11-01 16:32:00,https://www.screendaily.com/news/uk-ireland-box-office-down-year-on-year-in-october-hopes-pinned-on-november-slate/5198776.article,"UK-Ireland box office figures for October 2024 were down 17% compared to the previous year, causing the year-to-date figure to fall back to 11% down.
The underperformance of Joker: Folie À Deux meant the year-to-date comparison dropped from 10% down at the end of September. The 2024 box office is currently at £799.1m; total revenue for 2023 was £1.1bn. UK-Ireland top 10 titles October 2024 Rank Title Distributor October gross Total gross Release date 1 Joker: Folie À Deux Warner Bros £10.2m £10.2m 4/10/2024 2 The Wild Robot Universal £9.5m £9.5m 18/10/2024 3 Venom: The Last Dance Sony £6.9m £6.9m 25/10/2024 4 Smile 2 Paramount £4.9m £4.9m 18/10/2024 5 Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Warner Bros £4.3m £25.9m 6/9/2024 6 Transformers One Paramount £4m £4m 11/10/2024 7 Terrifier 3 Signature £3.1m £3.1m 11/10/2024 8 The Apprentice Studiocanal £1.8m £1.8m 18/10/2024 9 The Substance Mubi £1.8m £3.6m 20/9/2024 10 The Outrun Studiocanal £1.4m £2.2m 27/9/2024
Warner Bros' Folie À Deux was still the number one film in October with £10.2m, having opened to £5.6m at the beginning of the month. However it is likely to finish with less than one-fifth of the £58.3m of 2019's Joker , and is only the seventh-highest-grossing release for director Todd Phillips, who also made The Hangover films.
Dreamworks Animation's The Wild Robot took second spot with £9.5m after a £3.2m opening. It was the best-performing animation of the month, and is currently the fifth-highest-grossing animation of the year.
Independent titles made it into the top 10 again, with Terrifier 3 in seventh place with £3m – the highest-grossing film ever for Signature Entertainment.
Mubi's The Substance achieved the impressive feat of making the top 10 for successive months, in ninth place with £1.8m in October. It is Mubi's highest-grossing title ever, with £3.6m across its run.
Studiocanal also had two titles in the top 10 – Donald Trump drama The Apprentice in eight place with £1.8m, and Nora Fingscheidt's The Outrun starring Saoirse Ronan in 10th with £1.4m.
Despite those bright spots, none of the October releases came close to making the year-to-date top 10 ( Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes currently in 10th with £15.8m).
Exhibitors still need a strong November and December to make up the shortcomings. After a slate of awards contenders this weekend including Anora and Blitz , Studiocanal's Paddington In Peru from November 8 will need to climb towards the £38m and £42.6m of the first two films, while big figures are also needed from Paramount's Gladiator II (November 15), Universal musical adaptation Wicked (November 22) and Disney animation Moana 2 (November 29).

GBP to USD conversion rate: 1.30
Sony's Venom: The Last Dance started with a £4.3m weekend – enough to top the UK-Ireland box office, although down on the starts of the first two films in the franchise.
The Last Dance played in 622 sites, taking a £6,915 location average. This is down on the £5.6m start of 2018's Venom , from 556 sites at a £10,160 average; and the £6.2m start of 2021's Venom: Let There Be Carnage , from 597 sites at a £10,331 average.
The Last Dance has surpassed the openings of several recent comic book adaptations, including The Flash (£4.25m in June 2023), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (£3.7m in August 2023) and The Marvels (£3.4m in November 2023).
It knocked Chris Sanders' The Wild Robot down to second. The Dreamworks animation fell 37% from its opening weekend, with £1.9m, and is at £6.4m so far – down slightly on the £6.7m of fellow Universal animation Migration at the same stage in 2023. That film ended on £21.5m, so crossing the £20m mark is still a possible achievement for The Wild Robot .
Paramount horror Smile 2 added just over £1m on its second weekend, a drop of 40.5% that brings it to £4m in total. It has slipped behind the rate of 2022's Smile , which had £4.8m at this stage and ended on £11.7m.
Former number one Transformers One posted a £377,581 third weekend – a 41.2% drop that brings it to £3.4m in total for Paramount.
It held slightly better than Studiocanal's The Apprentice , which still maintained a top five spot. It dropped 42.1% with £372,604 bringing it to £1.6m from two weekends.
Pedro Almodovar's first English-language feature film The Room Next Door started with £239,043 – slightly down on his previous film, 2022's Parallel Mothers with £247,075, and less than his record opening of £433,283 for 2006's Volver . Playing in 233 sites, The Room Next Door made a £1,026 site average.
Elsewhere, Coralie Fargeat's The Substance has become Mubi's highest-grossing title in the UK and Ireland. The film posted another excellent hold on its sixth weekend, dropping just 32% with £150,000 taking it to £3.4m, ahead of the £3.3m of 2024's Priscilla . The Substance is already Mubi's highest-grossing worldwide release, topping the $10m figure of Priscilla from Mubi territories at the start of this month.

Weekend Box Office: Venom: The Last Dance Bromances Its Way to $51 Million Debut,Erik Childress,2024-10-28 20:39:04,https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/weekend-box-office-venom-the-last-dance-bromances-its-way-to-51-million-debut,"October was not nearly the month that some had hoped it would be and that primarily falls on the shoulders of one particular DC musical sequel. This is not to say it has not had its headlines. Terrifier 3 has been a great story. Smile 2 has done fine. September holdovers Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and The Wild Robot have contributed nicely. All that being said, while the month may indeed be the lowest on record post-pandemic, the autumn season didn't even need the success of Folie A Deux to have its best turnout since 2019, likely coming in just shy of a billion dollars. If only the new Venom movie had done business like its predecessors, the season may have crossed that threshold. King of the Crop: Venom: The Last Dance Bromances Its Way to $51 Million Debut
Do you remember the great Venom vs. A Star Is Born battle of 2018? It was Romance vs. Bromance, and Sony's Marvel spin-off opened to $80.2 million. Bradley Cooper's remake started with $42.9 million on the same weekend and ultimately bested Ruben Fleischer's film by $1.6 million and change. It was one of the rare instances of gigantic hits (both over $200 million domestic) opening on the same date. Venom , of course, won the worldwide battle by almost $420 million, grossing $856 million globally. The sequel directed by Andy Serkis, Venom: Let There Be Carnage , had an equally great story to tell when it opened to $90 million, the biggest opening of the pandemic to date in October 2021 and one that was bested that year only by Sony's Spider-Man: No Way Home . Its $213.55 million domestic gross was almost identical to the original's $213.51 million, even though its global total was understandably down. And by down, we mean it still made $506.8 million.
That brings us three years later to Venom: The Last Dance . The series is on its third director, Kelly Marcel (writer of the first two, who also contributed rewrites to earlier Tom Hardy films Bronson and Mad Max: Fury Road ), and we're now in the era of comic book fatigue — or mediocrity, or disinterest, or whatever label you want to put on it — for something not involving the combo meal of two characters in a crossover event. With its $51 million debut, The Last Dance is the fifth $50+ million start for Sony this year. To put it in context, that's a lower start than last year's The Flash and less than $5 million higher than The Marvels .
Even if The Last Dance grosses higher than those films — and that seems likely — a finish around $125 million won't even get the film halfway to profit. Thankfully, that is where its fans overseas kick in. The reported budget of the film was $120 million, and international territories have already added $124 million to the gross. That could be more in one weekend than it grosses in North America in its whole run. As long as it doubles up its domestic gross on the international side, Sony will have gotten three solid hits out of this series, continuing a good year that has included Bad Boys: Ride or Die , It Ends With Us , and The Garfield Movie . That's more than enough to put aside the failures of Madame Web , Harold and the Purple Crayon , and the fifth Ghostbusters .

Smile 2 nearly matched the original's opening last week, besting it by around just half a million. It would have liked to have matched the original's second week drop, too, of just 18.3%. Instead, it fell nearly 60% down to $9.5 million. It is now nearly a full $10 million off the first film's 10-day total of $50.7 million and has grossed barely half of its predecessor's second weekend. So let's stop comparing the two and look back at the numbers of Happy Death Day , which had a $9.3 million second weekend and a 10-day gross of $40.6 million. That is a better view of where Smile 2 may be headed, which would be in the $55 million range. Internationally, the film has made another $43 million, and even with that domestic estimate, the film will have no problem achieving over $100 million globally and turning a theatrical profit.
Chris Sanders' The Wild Robot is currently enjoying the profit phase of its release as well. It passed $200 million globally before the weekend, and with another $6.8 million, its domestic total is at $111.6 million. The film has been slowly losing its pace with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs ; it was ahead last week by $6 million, but only by a little over $3 million this week. Cloudy won the fifth weekend $8 million to $6.5 million, but the $125-130 million estimate is holding steady for now, if closer to the lower number. The Wild Robot has added another $121 million internationally already, and Universal should be happy with the returns for this.
Having a decent showing is Conclave , Edward Berger's follow-up to his Oscar-winning Netflix adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front . This PG-rated papal thriller with Ralph Fiennes is considered an awards contender this year as well, and adults put $6.6 million in the collection plate of 1,753 theaters. It's only the second $5+ million start for Focus Features this year after Jeff Nichols' The Bikeriders started with $9.6 million in June and finished with $21.6 million. That's also the only film they have had gross over $10 million total domestically this year, even if the Pharrell Williams Lego doc Piece by Piece is getting close after making another $720,000 this weekend; that film stands at $8.88 million. Focus is hoping they can make Conclave play into awards season. Last year they platformed Alexander Payne's The Holdovers on this same weekend and it went on to gross $20.3 million.
Speaking of great stories and films into profit, Damien Leone's Terrifier 3 continues to draw an audience on the pre-Halloween weekend. $4.7 million this weekend brings its total to $44.5 million. At this point it is one of the 25 most profitable films of the year, a list that also includes fellow horror films Alien: Romulus , A Quiet Place: Day One , Longlegs , Speak No Evil , Tarot , and The Strangers: Chapter 1 . Smile 2 could ultimately join that group as well.
A24 tried the same approach with John Crowley's We Live In Time , starting with a five-theater launch, then moving it last week into 985 theaters. This weekend it tripled its theaters (2,924), the biggest move the studio has made after an initial limited release. Halina Reijn's Bodies Bodies Bodies doubled from 1,290-to-2,541 theaters in weekend three and grossed $2.37 million. (They are also releasing the Reijn's Babygirl with Nicole Kidman in December). Sofia Coppola's Priscilla last year moved from 1,359-to-2,361 theaters, and it made $4.6 million, ultimately grossing over $20 million. We Live In Time added $4.8 million to bring its 17-day total to $11.7 million. The studio's bump of Ex Machina back in 2015 to 1,255 theaters in its third weekend got it $5.34 million and it went on to make over $25 million. We Live In Time is almost halfway there.
Wrapping up the top ten we still have Tim Burton's Beetlejuice Beetlejuice on its quest for $300 million domestic. Adding $3.1 million brings the total to $288.6 million. Its pace animal, Attack of the Clones , had $291.2 million after its eighth weekend of $2.45 million. It remains on track as it also approaches an end run of over $450 million worldwide. Inflation notwithstanding, this is Burton's third highest-grossing film and third most profitable, up there with Alice In Wonderland and Batman .
Sean Baker's Anora moved from six theaters into 34 this weekend and grossed $909,000 to grab eighth place. That's a $26,730 per-theater average for the Neon release. In 1997 Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights went from two theaters in its opening to 30 theaters in its second week to gross $869,146, and Barry Jenkins' Moonlight made $850,114 in its second weekend after expanding to 36 theaters, just to show you the kind of company that Anora is keeping. Boogie Nights and Moonlight grossed $26.4 million and $27.8 million, respectively.
Todd Phillips' Joker spent nine weeks in the top 10 in 2019. Joker: Folie a Deux has fallen out after just three. Another 72% drop to $600,000 brings it to just $57 million. It is now going to get outgrossed by Transformers One , which made $720,000 for a total of $57.9 million. The roughly $200 million production has just crossed $201 million globally, which helps it clear a handful-plus of films that are actually bigger bombs. But how about this for its record? The worst multiple for a film opening in over 3,000 theaters that didn't have pandemic implications to it (Disney's Onward was released just before it started) or day-and-date streamers (like Halloween Ends and Five Nights at Freddy's ) is 1.76, which was achieved by Eli Roth's Borderlands . Joker: Folie a Deux is currently at approximately 1.51. Even Onward finished its brief 11-day run with a 1.57 multiple.
Also outside of the top 10, Coralie Fargeat's The Substance fell only 30% and grossed $605,000 to bring its total up to $14.5 million. The Nightmare Before Christmas made another $507,000 to bring its re-issue from Disney to $5.8 million. For more adult animation, Adam Elliot's Memoir of a Snail , released by IFC, made $64,000 in five theaters. On the Vine: Forrest Gump Reunion Film Here Charts Centuries of History
Sony hopes to have a 1-2 punch when they release Robert Zemeckis' new drama Here , with Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, next week. The 30-years-in-the-making Forrest Gump reunion that spans decades more than that is hoping to get better play than when Sony released Zemeckis' The Walk in the wake of The Martian back in 2015. Getting an even smaller peek is Clint Eastwood's new film Juror #2 , which Warner Bros. is inexplicably releasing into only 50 theaters and reportedly not even going to release box office grosses on. No matter how upset they may be over the reviews and grosses for their Joker musical, that's a helluva way to treat a 94-year-old filmmaker who may have delivered his final hurrah to a studio he has been (with only a very few exceptions like Absolute Power and Changeling ) fiercely loyal to since 1976. As for films studios do care about, Searchlight is releasing Jesse Eisenberg's sophomore directorial effort A Real Pain , starring himself and Kieran Culkin. The Sundance pickup is tracking well with critics and expected to make a few waves this awards season, as is Steve McQueen's Blitz , which is getting a limited run from Apple before heading to its streaming service on Nov. 22.

No premiere has brought Venom down,time news,2024-11-12 15:52:34,https://time.news/no-premiere-has-brought-venom-down,"13
Venom has won another weekend, and ⁢its cumulative total is expected to reach half a million viewers ​by next weekend.
Curiosity: in the entire top 20 there is no film that has⁢ exceeded that threshold, because Joker 2 barely remained​ at 455,000 and it seems that its journey is already over, its performance is far from that ⁣of the first chapter.
The Time We Have was the ‌best premiere of the week and came in second place with 43,500 viewers and a per-theater average just higher than Venom
Code Red Suit came in third ‌with 42,791 and a lower average.
Then many other premieres⁤ appeared, but with poor results,​ including ⁣the national⁤ film More ⁤People Die on Sunday‍ which had only 1,866 spectators in 23 theaters, with an average of 81 spectators. And although above it ⁤No te suela with double the ⁢number of spectators,​ having four times the number of theaters, its average was really bad with only 44 people per theater in the 4 days of screening measured.
