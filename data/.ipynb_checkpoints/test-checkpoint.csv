Joker 2 Earns $40M Against Reported $190M Budget -,Douglas Judd Barnett Jr.,,https://movies.mxdwn.com/news/joker-2-earns-40m-against-reported-190m-budget,"Per ScreenRant, Joker 2: Folie à Deux 's first weekend at the box office will come out to about half of the initial earnings of the Todd Phillips-directed original in 2019. Despite earning $40M and standing at No. 1 this week in the domestic box office, Joker 2 fell short of insider estimates ranging between $42-47M. The film also posed a much higher budget than the original at an estimated $190M, featuring musical numbers and stars like Lady Gaga joining the cast.
In its second week at the box office, The Wild Robot continues its success with an additional $18.7M, presenting a 48% drop against its $35M last week, placing at No. 2 this week. Also in its second week of release, Coppola's Megalopolis has slipped down to No. 10, earning $1.1M for a 73% drop.
A surprising top-ten entry comes in the form of Sam and Colby: The Legends of the Paranormal , a film starring two YouTubers. The film earned $1.8M while appearing in just 302 theaters.
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice slowly continues its decline down the ladder, down one place to No. 3 this week, adding $10M to its total gross. The Substance, a quiet critical success, earned $1.3M to keep it on the top-ten list.

"DreamWorks 'The Wild Robot' Goes #1 In U.S. With 35 Million, 'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice' Falls To Second -",Douglas Judd Barnett Jr.,,https://movies.mxdwn.com/news/dreamworks-the-wild-robot-goes-1-in-u-s-with-35-million-beetlejuice-beetlejuice-falls-to-second,"Still from 'The Wild Robot' trailer.
In what has become a great year for animated features, Chris Sanders' The Wild Robot made a splash in the weekend box office, earning $35M domestically. This makes the film the 15th-strongest domestic debut of the year so far, wedged between Alien: Romulus ($42M) and IF ($33.7M). The Wild Robot joins the ranks of Inside Out 2 ($155M), Despicable Me 4 ($75M), and Kung Fu Panda 4 ($57M) for the best-performing box office performances from animated features in 2024, per Cinema Blend.
However, The Wild Robot stands out as an original I.P. in a field dominated by sequels and reboots. The film also made $18M in the foreign market, tallying about $53M total for the global weekend debut. Chris Sanders wrote and directed The Wild Robot , and it has debuted to positive critical and audience reception, with Rotten Tomatoes scores sitting at 98% in both categories.
The Wild Robot is only the second film to take the No. 1 spot this September, with Beetlejuice Beetlejuice 's reign ending after three weeks at the top. The Beetlejuice sequel pulled $16M this weekend, earning No. 2 on the weekend rankings. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice has now made about $250M, placing sixth for domestic performances in 2024 behind Lee Isaac Chung's Twisters . It sits at $373M worldwide.
Francis Ford Coppola's Megalopolis debuted at No. 6, earning $4M against a reported budget of $120M. After many years of development and a cast including Adam Driver, Aubrey Plaza, Giancarlo Esposito, Shia Labeouf, and Laurence Fishburne, the reception has been varied. Playing on just 1,854 screens, the film is a surrealist vision from one of cinema's most celebrated directors, a trait that has made it polarizing for many viewers.
Joker Folie à Deux will debut this week, echoing the $1B success of the Todd Phillips' directed Joker which premiered in 2019. The current top ten box office performers from the weekend of 9/27-9/29 include:
1. The Wild Robot- Weekend: $35,000,000, Domestic: $35,000,000
2. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice- Weekend: $16,040,000, Domestic: $250,133,000

"Joker: Folie À Deux wins the weekend box office, but sure isn't smiling",Screenshot,,https://www.avclub.com/weekend-box-office-joker-folie-a-deux-bomb,"Joker: Folie À Deux may be turning into Todd Phillips' own villain origin story. Things went from bad to worse for the unsmiling sequel this weekend. First, it received a rare D CinemaScore from the Vegas-based firm that measures how much moviegoers enjoyed—or in this case, absolutely despised—a movie after sitting through it. (For context, that's even worse than the D+ score for Megalopolis —a movie that saw multiple walkouts in screenings attended by The A.V. Club alone. No wonder Coppola felt compelled to step in to defend his fellow bomb this past weekend.)
There's nothing to sing about for the Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix-led disaster at the box office either. Sure, the film technically won the weekend, with $40 million to The Wild Robot 's $19 million. But this is still an unmitigated low note for Warner Bros., who spent $190 million to make the thing—more than three times as much as the original Joker , according to The Hollywood Reporter . The film was projected to open at $50 million or $60 million, the trade reports, which was already a downgrade from last month's original projection of $70 million. Deadline notes that this is one of the lowest sequel openings for a comic book film ever—even worse than notorious MCU bomb The Marvels —meaning superhero fatigue may have turned into full-on narcolepsy.
There is some good news for Folie À Deux , however. Deadline reports that it's not the lowest opening for a DC movie ever . That honor goes to the Josh Brolin epic Jonah Hex , which no one saw (it opened at a mere $5.3 million). It also scored a big win for movie musicals; its opening weekend netted more than the entire domestic gross of Cats ($27.1 million) in 2019. Way to go, Joker !
The rest of the top 10, via Box Office Mojo , is below: Joker: Folie à Deux, $40 million The Wild Robot, $18.7 million Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, $10.3 million Transformers One, $5.4 million Speak No Evil, $2.8 million Sam and Colby: The Legends of the Paranormal, $1.8 million White Bird, $1.5 million Deadpool & Wolverine, $1.5 million The Substance, $1.3 million Megalopolis, $1 million"
"After Months Of Hype, Joker: Folie À Deux Seriously Underwhelms At The Weekend Box Office",Eric Eisenberg,,https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/box-office/after-months-hype-joker-folie-a-deux-seriously-underwhelms-weekend-box-office,"Box office expectations for Todd Phillips' Joker: Folie À Deux have been building for months (if not years). When Joker came out in 2019, it ended up being a phenomenon – not just earning over $1 billion worldwide, but becoming the highest grossing R-rated film of all time and earning star Joaquin Phoenix an Academy Award. Movie-goers around the world anticipated that its sequel would be able to garner as much buzz and enthusiasm, particularly with Lady Gaga in a prominent supporting role... but that didn't end up happening.
Instead, Joker: Folie À Deux is quickly turning into a debacle. The extremely expensive follow-up film has been getting rough treatment from critics and audiences alike, and it has resulted in underwhelming box office numbers in its opening weekend. Check out the full Top 10 below and join me after for analysis.

As noted, Joker was a massive hit when it was released in late 2019, and it wasn't a film that had to slowly find an audience. The movie promised to be a new and different kind of cinematic experience for comic book fans, and loads of hype led the film to earn $96.2 million domestically in its first three days of release – despite the handicap of its R-rating. In the run up to its theatrical release, Joker: Folie À Deux was expected to put up similar numbers... but that didn't happen. It didn't even come close.
According to early results posted by The Numbers, Joker: Folie À Deux is making less than half of what the 2019 movie brought in during its opening weekend. Making $40 million during an opening weekend in 2024 isn't by itself a total disaster (it's the fifteenth biggest debut of the year, slightly behind the $42 million earned by Fede Álvarez's Alien: Romulus in August), but compared to what prognosticators prognosticated, it's a very bad start.
It wouldn't be an issue if Joker: Folie À Deux was made with a budget similar to its predecessor... but the filmmakers and the studio got extremely cocky with the follow-up film. According to a Variety report back in February, Joker was made for a modest $60 million, but the musical follow-up cost nearly four times as much, with reported production costs in the $200 million range. The sequel would be in a solid financial position if opening weekend ticket sales remained consistent, but they didn't, and it appears now as though the Joaquin Phoenix/Lady Gaga movie is going to have a legacy as one of 2024's box office debacles.

In addition to its rough debut, Joker: Folie À Deux appears as though it has a tough word of mouth problem ahead of it as well. Critiques first started arriving online following the movie's premiere at the Venice Film Festival (you can read my 2.5 star Joker: Folie À Deux CinemaBlend review posted last month), and while there wasn't an overwhelming amount of love for the release right off the bat, things have gotten much worse for the title following its theatrical arrival. In addition to having nearly matching rough scores on Rotten Tomatoes, the title has earned a ""D"" grade from surveys handed out by CinemaScore (the previous film, despite its grimness, earned a ""B+"")
While the film is not performing well domestically, there is a silver lining that comes from foreign markets. So far, Joker: Folie à Deux has made $81 million from outside the United States and Canada, which brings its worldwide total to $121 million. That being said, ticket sales are expected to plummet in the weeks ahead, and the aforementioned budget for the sequel doesn't include publicity and marketing costs.

How this will ultimately affect the box office in the macro sense for the rest of October will be an interesting development to watch. There was expectation in the industry that Joker 2 would be a dominant title all month, but the chances of it repeating at number one in next weekend's box office Top 10 seem slim. That could create opportunity for the big titles set to arrive in theaters in the weeks ahead (including Kelly Marcel's Venom: The Last Dance and Parker Finn's Smile 2 ... but it also may end up deflating the market.
Needless to say, next weekend's ticket sales will be interesting. The Wild Robot Has A Soft Drop Amid Awesome Buzz
The rough performance of Joker: Folie À Deux is a bummer for anyone rooting for the health of the industry, but one positive to take away from this weekend's box office results is the performance by Chris Sanders' The Wild Robot . Despite opening at number one last Sunday, the new release from DreamWorks Animation didn't have what could be called a blockbuster debut when it arrived in theaters at the end of September, but one thing the film has going for it is that just about everybody who sees it falls in love with it (I, for one, gave The Wild Robot 4.5 stars in my CinemaBlend review). The movie has earned wonderful appreciation from critics and audiences, and that positivity resulted in what could be called a successful second Friday-to-Sunday.
Bumped down to second place because of the release of Joker: Folie À Deux , The Wild Robot added $18.7 million domestically to its coffers in the last three days, which is a soft 48 percent weekend-to-weekend drop following its solid debut. To date, the animated film featuring the voices of Lupita Nyong'o and Pedro Pascal has made $64 million in the United States and Canada, and when combined with the ticket sales abroad ($35.5 million), the title has earned over $100 million worldwide. Those results aren't exactly comparable to Mike Mitchell's Kung Fu Panda 4 or Kelsey Mann's Inside Out 2 from earlier in the year, but not being a sequel, it also doesn't have the advantage of having a massive built-in audience.
Looking ahead to next week, the current slate of titles will have some interesting new movies to compete with, as Ali Abbasi's The Apprentice starring Sebastian Stan, Damien Leone's vomit-inducing slasher Terrifier 3, and Morgan Neville's Pharrell Williams biopic Piece By Piece , and Jason Reitman's Saturday Night will all be arriving in wide release. Be sure to head back here to CinemaBlend next Sunday to check out the weekend box office results, and head over to our 2024 Movie Release Calendar to discover all of the titles set to hit theaters and streaming in the remaining weeks/months of the year."

Director Todd Phillips' sequel to his 2019 blockbuster, which stars Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, has received mostly poor reviews and failed to match the $96.2 million opening weekend of the first film.

NEW YORK — Francis Ford Coppola's decades-in-the-making, self-financed epic 'Megalopolis' flopped with moviegoers, while the acclaimed DreamWorks Animation family film 'The Wild Robot' soared to No. 1 at the weekend box office.

'The Wild Robot,' Chris Sanders' adaptation of Peter Brown's bestseller, outperformed expectations to launch with $35 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canada theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. 'Wild Robot' was poised to do well after critics raved about the story of a shipwrecked robot who raises an orphan gosling. Audiences agreed, giving the film an A CinemaScore. 'Wild Robot' is likely set up a long and lucrative run for the Universal Pictures release.
Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, predicts 'The Wild Robot' 'may take a page from the 'Elemental' playbook by opening to respectable box office and then looking toward long-term playability.' Pixar's 'Elemental,' which like 'The Wild Robot' wasn't a sequel, debuted with a modest $30 million but went on to gross nearly $500 million worldwide.
Family movies, led by the year's biggest hit in 'Inside Out 2,' have particularly powered the box office this year. David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, said the genre should reach $6 billion worldwide in 2024 — which, he noted, 'is back to pre-pandemic levels.'

'Megalopolis,' Coppola's vision of a Roman epic set in modern-day New York, was never expected to perform close to that level. But the film's $4 million debut was still sobering for a movie that Coppola bankrolled himself for $120 million. Following its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, critics have been mixed on Coppola's first film in 13 years. Audiences gave in a D+ CinemaScore.
By any financial measure, 'Megalopolis' was a mega-flop. But from the start, the 85-year-old Coppola maintained money wasn't his concern. Coppola fashioned the film, which he first began developing in the late 1970s, as a grand personal statement about human possibility.
'Everyone's so worried about money,' Coppola told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of the film's release. 'I say: Give me less money and give me more friends.'
Studios passed on 'Megalopolis' after Cannes. Lionsgate ultimately stepped forward to distribute it, for a fee. Coppola also picked up the tab for most of its $15 million in marketing costs. The film, which stars Adam Driver, Nathalie Emmanuel and Aubrey Plaza, also played in about 200 IMAX locations, which accounted for $1.8 million of its ticket sales.

After three weeks atop the box office, Tim Burton's 'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice' slid to second place with $16 million in its fourth weekend of release. The Warner Bros. sequel to the 1988 'Beetlejuice,' starring Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder, has amassed $250 million domestically in a month of release.
Third place went to 'Transformers One,' the Transformers prequel starring Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry. After its lower-than expected debut last weekend, the Paramount release collected $9.3 million on its second weekend.
'Megalopolis' was even bested by the Indian Telugu-language action film 'Devara: Part 1.' It grossed $5.1 million in its opening weekend, good enough for fourth place.
Also debuting in theaters was Jason Reitman's 'Saturday Night,' an affectionate dramatization of the sketch-comedy institution on the night it first aired in 1975. On the same weekend the NBC series began its 50th season, Reitman's movie launched in five New York and Los Angeles theaters and collected $265,000, good for a strong $53,000 per-theater average. 'Saturday Night' goes nationwide in two weeks.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 'The Wild Robot,' $35 million. 'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,' $16 million. 'Transformers One,' $9.3 million. 'Devara: Part 1,' $5.1 million. 'Speak No Evil,' $4.3 million. 'Megalopolis,' $4 million.
