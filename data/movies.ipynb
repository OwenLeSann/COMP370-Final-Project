To help us unpack this,\\u200b we have film industry\\u200c expert Dr. Sarah \\u200dConnors with us. \\u200bWelcome, Dr. Connors!\\nDr. Connors: Good morning! Thank you for\\u200d having me.\\nEditor: \\u2063Let's dive right in. 'Venom: The Last Dance' managed to stay at the top of the box office this past weekend, with an impressive 107,000 viewers. What do you think contributed to its ability to maintain the first place from its national premiere?\\nDr. Connors: Well, first and foremost,\\u200b the anticipation surrounding the 'Venom' franchise certainly plays \\u2064a significant \\u2062role. Fans of the \\u2064comic book series\\u2063 tend\\u2062 to flock to \\u2063the theater, and with the sequel, there's already a built-in audience. Additionally, the action-packed trailers and marketing\\u200b strategies have\\u2064 kept\\u2064 the buzz alive, even if critical reception hasn't been stellar.\\nEditor: Interestingly, you mentioned the critical\\u200d reception. Both\\u2063 'Venom'\\u2062 and\\u2063 'Joker \\u200d2' have \\u2064faced poor reviews, yet 'Venom' is projected to match 'Joker 2″\\u200d in sales soon. What does this say about audience preferences?\\nDr. Connors: \\u2064It highlights\\u2064 the disconnect sometimes between critical acclaim and audience appetite. Many viewers prioritize entertainment value over critical analysis when\\u2063 deciding on a film. Many will go for popular franchises or\\u2062 films\\u2063 that have a\\u200b fun, adventurous premise, irrespective\\u2064 of\\u2064 what critics think. Audiences enjoy being entertained, \\u200cand 'Venom' offers that \\u200bthrill, while 'Joker 2' has a more \\u2062serious, somber tone that may not resonate with everyone.\\nEditor: Very true. Is there anything specific \\u200dabout 'Venom' that\\u2064 stands out in\\u2063 terms \\u2062of its box office \\u2063appeal compared \\u2063to other films like 'Terrifier 3,' \\u2064which came in \\u2064second with \\u200dnearly 72,000 viewers?\\nDr. Connors: Absolutely. 'Venom' benefits\\u2064 from\\u2063 a wider marketing machine and a more recognizable title.\\u2064 While 'Terrifier 3″\\u2062 is gaining traction and has \\u2064its\\u2064 own dedicated fanbase, it caters to a niche audience that appreciates horror specifically.\\u200b On the other hand, 'Venom' blends action and comic book lore, which has a \\u200cbroader appeal across different demographics.\\nEditor: We \\u200calso see other films like 'Wild Robot' performing\\u200c well. \\u200bIs there a reason audiences are turning toward a wider variety of genres \\u200cin the \\u2064current\\u200d market?\\nDr. Connors: Yes, definitely! The diversity of films currently available is helping to cater to different tastes and preferences. Audiences are becoming more open to exploring different genres,\\u200d including animated features like\\u200b 'Wild Robot,' which can attract \\u2064families and younger viewers. The\\u200c interplay of new releases and maintaining established franchise continuity is creating a healthy competitive environment at the box\\u200c office.\\nEditor: It seems like there's a lot of momentum in the film industry right now. How do you see this trend\\u2064 evolving in the\\u200d coming months?\\nDr. Connors: I believe we'll see a continued blending of\\u2063 genres. Audiences enjoy variety, and studios are recognizing the potential financial rewards of diversifying their offerings. With more franchises \\u200blike 'Venom' releasing in the \\u2062superhero category and unique independent films gaining attention, we might see some exciting shifts in viewer demographics. The\\u2064 key will be for studios to balance both \\u200cblockbuster features and innovative storytelling to keep audiences engaged.\\nEditor: Great\\u2062 insights! Before we wrap\\u200d up, do you have \\u2063any predictions for\\u200c future box\\u200c office hits or sleeper successes?\\nDr. Connors: Based on current trends, I believe films \\u200bthat merge established\\u2064 franchises with fresh storytelling\\u2062 will\\u2064 dominate. Also, keep an eye on indie films that are breaking the mold—there's potential for surprises in\\u2064 that sector. The critical reception might not dictate all, but authentic stories resonate \\u2064well with audiences, which could lead to unexpected successes.\\nEditor: Thank you, Dr. Connors! It's been enlightening to explore the box office landscape \\u200bwith you. We look forward to \\u2063seeing how these trends evolve.\\nDr. Connors: Thank you! I had a wonderful time discussing these\\u200d trends with you. 0 comments 0 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email\",\n",

But what is stunning is it is nowhere to be found among the more than 80 movies listed on their daily list, nor has it since it was released. 'Goodrich' (Bleecker Street) with Michael Keaton, which grossed barely over $1 million is #24 Monday. 'The Apprentice' (Briarcliff), with a $4 million total, made the top 10 its opening week.

But perhaps its status as a film which was distributed as a service deal by Lionsgate (as effectively as was possible under tough circumstances) reduced its marketing and other awareness elements. Still, it's shocking.\\nLess shocking is that Netflix subscribers preferred between two prime releases the conventional holiday-oriented rom-com '\\n'Emilia' isn't in the top 10, which is not surprising. The Mexican-made, French produced (it's their Oscar submission) drama centering on an audacious character's transition into a woman is a specialized film, and one that if it had a conventional theatrical release, even in the hands of Neon or A24, would have been an unlikely box office top 10 contender.

However it is likely to finish with less than one-fifth of the £58.3m of 2019's Joker , and is only the seventh-highest-grossing release for director Todd Phillips, who also made The Hangover films.\\nDreamworks Animation's The Wild Robot took second spot with £9.5m after a £3.2m opening. It was the best-performing animation of the month, and is currently the fifth-highest-grossing animation of the year.\\nIndependent titles made it into the top 10 again, with Terrifier 3 in seventh place with £3m – the highest-grossing film ever for Signature Entertainment.\\nMubi's The Substance achieved the impressive feat of making the top 10 for successive months, in ninth place with £1.8m in October. It is Mubi's highest-grossing title ever, with £3.6m across its run.\\nStudiocanal also had two titles in the top 10 – Donald Trump drama The Apprentice in eight place with £1.8m, and Nora Fingscheidt's The Outrun starring Saoirse Ronan in 10th with £1.4m.\\nDespite those bright spots, none of the October releases came close to making the year-to-date top 10 ( Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes currently in 10th with £15.8m).\\nExhibitors still need a strong November and December to make up the shortcomings. After a slate of awards contenders this weekend including Anora and Blitz , Studiocanal's Paddington In Peru from November 8 will need to climb towards the £38m and £42.6m of the first two films, while big figures are also needed from Paramount's Gladiator II (November 15), Universal musical adaptation Wicked (November 22) and Disney animation Moana 2 (November 29).\\nAll figures in this article were provided by Comscore.\",\n",

Smile 2 (Paramount) £1m £4m 2 4. Transformers One (Paramount) £377,581 £3.4m 3 5. The Apprentice (Studiocanal) £372,604 £1.6m 2\\nGBP to USD conversion rate: 1.30\\nSony's Venom: The Last Dance started with a £4.3m weekend – enough to top the UK-Ireland box office, although down on the starts of the first two films in the franchise.\\nThe Last Dance played in 622 sites, taking a £6,915 location average. This is down on the £5.6m start of 2018's Venom , from 556 sites at a £10,160 average; and the £6.2m start of 2021's Venom: Let There Be Carnage , from 597 sites at a £10,331 average.\\nThe Last Dance has surpassed the openings of several recent comic book adaptations, including The Flash (£4.25m in June 2023), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (£3.7m in August 2023) and The Marvels (£3.4m in November 2023).\\nIt knocked Chris Sanders' The Wild Robot down to second. The Dreamworks animation fell 37% from its opening weekend, with £1.9m, and is at £6.4m so far – down slightly on the £6.7m of fellow Universal animation Migration at the same stage in 2023. That film ended on £21.5m, so crossing the £20m mark is still a possible achievement for The Wild Robot .\\nParamount horror Smile 2 added just over £1m on its second weekend, a drop of 40.5% that brings it to £4m in total. It has slipped behind the rate of 2022's Smile , which had £4.8m at this stage and ended on £11.7m.\\nFormer number one Transformers One posted a £377,581 third weekend – a 41.2% drop that brings it to £3.4m in total for Paramount.\\nIt held slightly better than Studiocanal's The Apprentice , which still maintained a top five spot. It dropped 42.1% with £372,604 bringing it to £1.6m from two weekends.\\nPedro Almodovar's first English-language feature film The Room Next Door started with £239,043 – slightly down on his previous film, 2022's Parallel Mothers with £247,075, and less than his record opening of £433,283 for 2006's Volver . Playing in 233 sites, The Room Next Door made a £1,026 site average.\\nElsewhere, Coralie Fargeat's The Substance has become Mubi's highest-grossing title in the UK and Ireland. The film posted another excellent hold on its sixth weekend, dropping just 32% with £150,000 taking it to £3.4m, ahead of the £3.3m of 2024's Priscilla . The Substance is already Mubi's highest-grossing worldwide release, topping the $10m figure of Priscilla from Mubi territories at the start of this month.\\nMore to follow.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Meanwhile, papal thriller Conclave earns the No. 4 spot, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice keeps making money, and Joker: Folie à Deux drops out of the top 10.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"October was not nearly the month that some had hoped it would be and that primarily falls on the shoulders of one particular DC musical sequel. This is not to say it has not had its headlines. Terrifier 3 has been a great story. Smile 2 has done fine. September holdovers Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and The Wild Robot have contributed nicely. All that being said, while the month may indeed be the lowest on record post-pandemic, the autumn season didn't even need the success of Folie A Deux to have its best turnout since 2019, likely coming in just shy of a billion dollars. If only the new Venom movie had done business like its predecessors, the season may have crossed that threshold. King of the Crop: Venom: The Last Dance Bromances Its Way to $51 Million Debut\\nDo you remember the great Venom vs. A Star Is Born battle of 2018? It was Romance vs. Bromance, and Sony's Marvel spin-off opened to $80.2 million. Bradley Cooper's remake started with $42.9 million on the same weekend and ultimately bested Ruben Fleischer's film by $1.6 million and change. It was one of the rare instances of gigantic hits (both over $200 million domestic) opening on the same date. Venom , of course, won the worldwide battle by almost $420 million, grossing $856 million globally. The sequel directed by Andy Serkis, Venom: Let There Be Carnage , had an equally great story to tell when it opened to $90 million, the biggest opening of the pandemic to date in October 2021 and one that was bested that year only by Sony's Spider-Man: No Way Home . Its $213.55 million domestic gross was almost identical to the original's $213.51 million, even though its global total was understandably down. And by down, we mean it still made $506.8 million.\\nThat brings us three years later to Venom: The Last Dance . The series is on its third director, Kelly Marcel (writer of the first two, who also contributed rewrites to earlier Tom Hardy films Bronson and Mad Max: Fury Road ), and we're now in the era of comic book fatigue — or mediocrity, or disinterest, or whatever label you want to put on it — for something not involving the combo meal of two characters in a crossover event. With its $51 million debut, The Last Dance is the fifth $50+ million start for Sony this year. To put it in context, that's a lower start than last year's The Flash and less than $5 million higher than The Marvels .\\nEven if The Last Dance grosses higher than those films — and that seems likely — a finish around $125 million won't even get the film halfway to profit. Thankfully, that is where its fans overseas kick in. The reported budget of the film was $120 million, and international territories have already added $124 million to the gross. That could be more in one weekend than it grosses in North America in its whole run. As long as it doubles up its domestic gross on the international side, Sony will have gotten three solid hits out of this series, continuing a good year that has included Bad Boys: Ride or Die , It Ends With Us , and The Garfield Movie . That's more than enough to put aside the failures of Madame Web , Harold and the Purple Crayon , and the fifth Ghostbusters . The Top 10 and Beyond: Conclave Debuts at No. 4, Joker Tumbles out of Top 10\\nSmile 2 nearly matched the original's opening last week, besting it by around just half a million. It would have liked to have matched the original's second week drop, too, of just 18.3%. Instead, it fell nearly 60% down to $9.5 million. It is now nearly a full $10 million off the first film's 10-day total of $50.7 million and has grossed barely half of its predecessor's second weekend. So let's stop comparing the two and look back at the numbers of Happy Death Day , which had a $9.3 million second weekend and a 10-day gross of $40.6 million. That is a better view of where Smile 2 may be headed, which would be in the $55 million range. Internationally, the film has made another $43 million, and even with that domestic estimate, the film will have no problem achieving over $100 million globally and turning a theatrical profit.\\nChris Sanders' The Wild Robot is currently enjoying the profit phase of its release as well. It passed $200 million globally before the weekend, and with another $6.8 million, its domestic total is at $111.6 million. The film has been slowly losing its pace with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs ; it was ahead last week by $6 million, but only by a little over $3 million this week. Cloudy won the fifth weekend $8 million to $6.5 million, but the $125-130 million estimate is holding steady for now, if closer to the lower number. The Wild Robot has added another $121 million internationally already, and Universal should be happy with the returns for this.\\nHaving a decent showing is Conclave , Edward Berger's follow-up to his Oscar-winning Netflix adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front . This PG-rated papal thriller with Ralph Fiennes is considered an awards contender this year as well, and adults put $6.6 million in the collection plate of 1,753 theaters. It's only the second $5+ million start for Focus Features this year after Jeff Nichols' The Bikeriders started with $9.6 million in June and finished with $21.6 million. That's also the only film they have had gross over $10 million total domestically this year, even if the Pharrell Williams Lego doc Piece by Piece is getting close after making another $720,000 this weekend; that film stands at $8.88 million. Focus is hoping they can make Conclave play into awards season. Last year they platformed Alexander Payne's The Holdovers on this same weekend and it went on to gross $20.3 million.\\nSpeaking of great stories and films into profit, Damien Leone's Terrifier 3 continues to draw an audience on the pre-Halloween weekend. $4.7 million this weekend brings its total to $44.5 million. At this point it is one of the 25 most profitable films of the year, a list that also includes fellow horror films Alien: Romulus , A Quiet Place: Day One , Longlegs , Speak No Evil , Tarot , and The Strangers: Chapter 1 . Smile 2 could ultimately join that group as well.\\nA24 tried the same approach with John Crowley's We Live In Time , starting with a five-theater launch, then moving it last week into 985 theaters. This weekend it tripled its theaters (2,924), the biggest move the studio has made after an initial limited release. Halina Reijn's Bodies Bodies Bodies doubled from 1,290-to-2,541 theaters in weekend three and grossed $2.37 million. (They are also releasing the Reijn's Babygirl with Nicole Kidman in December). Sofia Coppola's Priscilla last year moved from 1,359-to-2,361 theaters, and it made $4.6 million, ultimately grossing over $20 million. We Live In Time added $4.8 million to bring its 17-day total to $11.7 million. The studio's bump of Ex Machina back in 2015 to 1,255 theaters in its third weekend got it $5.34 million and it went on to make over $25 million. We Live In Time is almost halfway there.\\nWrapping up the top ten we still have Tim Burton's Beetlejuice Beetlejuice on its quest for $300 million domestic. Adding $3.1 million brings the total to $288.6 million. Its pace animal, Attack of the Clones , had $291.2 million after its eighth weekend of $2.45 million. It remains on track as it also approaches an end run of over $450 million worldwide. Inflation notwithstanding, this is Burton's third highest-grossing film and third most profitable, up there with Alice In Wonderland and Batman .\\nSean Baker's Anora moved from six theaters into 34 this weekend and grossed $909,000 to grab eighth place. That's a $26,730 per-theater average for the Neon release. In 1997 Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights went from two theaters in its opening to 30 theaters in its second week to gross $869,146, and Barry Jenkins' Moonlight made $850,114 in its second weekend after expanding to 36 theaters, just to show you the kind of company that Anora is keeping. Boogie Nights and Moonlight grossed $26.4 million and $27.8 million, respectively.\\nTodd Phillips' Joker spent nine weeks in the top 10 in 2019. Joker: Folie a Deux has fallen out after just three. Another 72% drop to $600,000 brings it to just $57 million. It is now going to get outgrossed by Transformers One , which made $720,000 for a total of $57.9 million. The roughly $200 million production has just crossed $201 million globally, which helps it clear a handful-plus of films that are actually bigger bombs. But how about this for its record? The worst multiple for a film opening in over 3,000 theaters that didn't have pandemic implications to it (Disney's Onward was released just before it started) or day-and-date streamers (like Halloween Ends and Five Nights at Freddy's ) is 1.76, which was achieved by Eli Roth's Borderlands . Joker: Folie a Deux is currently at approximately 1.51. Even Onward finished its brief 11-day run with a 1.57 multiple.\\nAlso outside of the top 10, Coralie Fargeat's The Substance fell only 30% and grossed $605,000 to bring its total up to $14.5 million. The Nightmare Before Christmas made another $507,000 to bring its re-issue from Disney to $5.8 million. For more adult animation, Adam Elliot's Memoir of a Snail , released by IFC, made $64,000 in five theaters. On the Vine: Forrest Gump Reunion Film Here Charts Centuries of History\\nSony hopes to have a 1-2 punch when they release Robert Zemeckis' new drama Here , with Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, next week. The 30-years-in-the-making Forrest Gump reunion that spans decades more than that is hoping to get better play than when Sony released Zemeckis' The Walk in the wake of The Martian back in 2015. Getting an even smaller peek is Clint Eastwood's new film Juror #2 , which Warner Bros. is inexplicably releasing into only 50 theaters and reportedly not even going to release box office grosses on. No matter how upset they may be over the reviews and grosses for their Joker musical, that's a helluva way to treat a 94-year-old filmmaker who may have delivered his final hurrah to a studio he has been (with only a very few exceptions like Absolute Power and Changeling ) fiercely loyal to since 1976. As for films studios do care about, Searchlight is releasing Jesse Eisenberg's sophomore directorial effort A Real Pain , starring himself and Kieran Culkin. The Sundance pickup is tracking well with critics and expected to make a few waves this awards season, as is Steve McQueen's Blitz , which is getting a limited run from Apple before heading to its streaming service on Nov. 22.
